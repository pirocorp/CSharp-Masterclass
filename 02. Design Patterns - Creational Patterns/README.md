Creational Design Patterns
==========================

In plain words
> Creational patterns are focused towards how to instantiate an object or group of related objects.

Wikipedia says
> In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

🏠 Simple Factory
--------------
Real world example
> Consider, you are building a house and you need doors. It would be a mess if every time you need a door, you put on your carpenter clothes and start making a door in your house. Instead you get it made from a factory.

In plain words
> Simple factory simply generates an instance for client without exposing any instantiation logic to the client

Wikipedia says
> In object-oriented programming (OOP), a factory is an object for creating other objects – formally a factory is a function or method that returns objects of a varying prototype or class from some method call, which is assumed to be "new".

**Programmatic Example**

First of all we have a door interface and the implementation
```C#
public interface IDoor
{
    int GetHeight();
    int GetWidth();
}

public class WoodenDoor : IDoor
{
    private int Height { get; set; }
    private int Width { get; set; }

    public WoodenDoor(int height, int width)
    {
        this.Height = height;
        this.Width = width;
    }

    public int GetHeight()
    {
        return this.Height;
    }
    public int GetWidth()
    {
        return this.Width;
    }
}
```
Then we have our door factory that makes the door and returns it
```C#
public static class DoorFactory
{
    public static IDoor MakeDoor(int height, int width)
    {
        return new WoodenDoor(height, width);
    }
}
```
And then it can be used as
```C#
var door = DoorFactory.MakeDoor(80, 30);
Console.WriteLine($"Height of Door : {door.GetHeight()}");
Console.WriteLine($"Width of Door : {door.GetWidth()}");
```

**When to Use?**

When creating an object is not just a few assignments and involves some logic, it makes sense to put it in a dedicated factory instead of repeating the same code everywhere.

🏭 Factory Method
--------------

Real world example
> Consider the case of a hiring manager. It is impossible for one person to interview for each of the positions. Based on the job opening, she has to decide and delegate the interview steps to different people.

In plain words
> It provides a way to delegate the instantiation logic to child classes.

Wikipedia says
> In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method—either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor.

 **Programmatic Example**

Taking our hiring manager example above. First of all we have an interviewer interface and some implementations for it

```C#
interface IInterviewer
{
    void AskQuestions();
}

class Developer : IInterviewer
{
    public void AskQuestions()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Asking about design patterns!");
    }
}

class CommunityExecutive : IInterviewer
{
    public void AskQuestions()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Asking about community building!");
    }
}
```

Now let us create our `HiringManager`

```C#
abstract class HiringManager
{
    // Factory method
    abstract protected IInterviewer MakeInterviewer();
    public void TakeInterview()
    {
        var interviewer = this.MakeInterviewer();
        interviewer.AskQuestions();
    }
}

```
Now any child can extend it and provide the required interviewer
```C#
class DevelopmentManager : HiringManager
{
    protected override IInterviewer MakeInterviewer()
    {
        return new Developer();
    }
}

class MarketingManager : HiringManager
{
    protected override IInterviewer MakeInterviewer()
    {
        return new CommunityExecutive();
    }
}

```
and then it can be used as

```C#
var devManager = new DevelopmentManager();
devManager.TakeInterview(); //Output : Asking about design patterns!

var marketingManager = new MarketingManager();
marketingManager.TakeInterview();//Output : Asking about community building!

```

**When to use?**

Useful when there is some generic processing in a class but the required sub-class is dynamically decided at runtime. Or putting it in other words, when the client doesn't know what exact sub-class it might need.

🔨 Abstract Factory
----------------

Real world example
> Extending our door example from Simple Factory. Based on your needs you might get a wooden door from a wooden door shop, iron door from an iron shop or a PVC door from the relevant shop. Plus you might need a guy with different kind of specialities to fit the door, for example a carpenter for wooden door, welder for iron door etc. As you can see there is a dependency between the doors now, wooden door needs carpenter, iron door needs a welder etc.

In plain words
> A factory of factories; a factory that groups the individual but related/dependent factories together without specifying their concrete classes.

Wikipedia says
> The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes

**Programmatic Example**

Translating the door example above. First of all we have our `Door` interface and some implementation for it

```C#
interface IDoor {

  void GetDescription();

}
class WoodenDoor : IDoor
{
  public void GetDescription()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("I am a wooden door");
  }
}

class IronDoor : IDoor
{
  public void GetDescription()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("I am a iron door");
  }
}
```
Then we have some fitting experts for each door type

```C#
interface IDoorFittingExpert
{
  void GetDescription();
}

class Welder : IDoorFittingExpert
{
  public void GetDescription()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("I can only fit iron doors");
  }
}

class Carpenter : IDoorFittingExpert
{
  public void GetDescription()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("I can only fit wooden doors");
  }
}
```

Now we have our abstract factory that would let us make family of related objects i.e. wooden door factory would create a wooden door and wooden door fitting expert and iron door factory would create an iron door and iron door fitting expert
```C#
interface IDoorFactory {
  IDoor MakeDoor();
  IDoorFittingExpert MakeFittingExpert();
}

// Wooden factory to return carpenter and wooden door
class WoodenDoorFactory : IDoorFactory
{
  public IDoor MakeDoor()
  {
    return new WoodenDoor();
  }

  public IDoorFittingExpert MakeFittingExpert()
  {
    return new Carpenter();
  }
}

// Iron door factory to get iron door and the relevant fitting expert
class IronDoorFactory : IDoorFactory
{
  public IDoor MakeDoor()
  {
    return new IronDoor();
  }

  public IDoorFittingExpert MakeFittingExpert()
  {
    return new Welder();
  }
}
```
And then it can be used as
```C#
var woodenDoorFactory = new WoodenDoorFactory();

var woodenDoor = woodenDoorFactory.MakeDoor();
var woodenDoorFittingExpert = woodenDoorFactory.MakeFittingExpert();

woodenDoor.GetDescription(); //Output : I am a wooden door
woodenDoorFittingExpert.GetDescription();//Output : I can only fit woooden doors

var ironDoorFactory = new IronDoorFactory();

var ironDoor = ironDoorFactory.MakeDoor();
var ironDoorFittingExpert = ironDoorFactory.MakeFittingExpert();

ironDoor.GetDescription();//Output : I am a iron door
ironDoorFittingExpert.GetDescription();//Output : I can only fit iron doors
```

As you can see the wooden door factory has encapsulated the `carpenter` and the `wooden door` also iron door factory has encapsulated the `iron door` and `welder`. And thus it had helped us make sure that for each of the created door, we do not get a wrong fitting expert.   

**When to use?**

When there are interrelated dependencies with not-that-simple creation logic involved

👷 Builder
--------------------------------------------
Real world example
> Imagine you are at Hardee's and you order a specific deal, lets say, "Big Hardee" and they hand it over to you without *any questions*; this is the example of simple factory. But there are cases when the creation logic might involve more steps. For example you want a customized Subway deal, you have several options in how your burger is made e.g what bread do you want? what types of sauces would you like? What cheese would you want? etc. In such cases builder pattern comes to the rescue.

In plain words
> Allows you to create different flavors of an object while avoiding constructor pollution. Useful when there could be several flavors of an object. Or when there are a lot of steps involved in creation of an object.

Wikipedia says
> The builder pattern is an object creation software design pattern with the intentions of finding a solution to the telescoping constructor anti-pattern.

Having said that let me add a bit about what telescoping constructor anti-pattern is. At one point or the other we have all seen a constructor like below:

```C#
public Burger(int size, bool cheese, bool pepperoni, bool lettuce, bool tomato)
{
}
```

As you can see; the number of constructor parameters can quickly get out of hand and it might become difficult to understand the arrangement of parameters. Plus this parameter list could keep on growing if you would want to add more options in future. This is called telescoping constructor anti-pattern.

**Programmatic Example**

The sane alternative is to use the builder pattern. First of all we have our burger that we want to make

```C#
class Burger
{
  private int mSize;
  private bool mCheese;
  private bool mPepperoni;
  private bool mLettuce;
  private bool mTomato;

  public Burger(BurgerBuilder builder)
  {
    this.mSize = builder.Size;
    this.mCheese = builder.Cheese;
    this.mPepperoni = builder.Pepperoni;
    this.mLettuce = builder.Lettuce;
    this.mTomato = builder.Tomato;
  }

  public string GetDescription()
  {
    var sb = new StringBuilder();
    sb.Append($"This is {this.mSize} inch Burger. ");
    return sb.ToString();
  }
}
```

And then we have the builder

```C#
class BurgerBuilder {
  public int Size;
  public bool Cheese;
  public bool Pepperoni;
  public bool Lettuce;
  public bool Tomato;

  public BurgerBuilder(int size)
  {
    this.Size = size;
  }

  public BurgerBuilder AddCheese()
  {
    this.Cheese = true;
    return this;
  }

  public BurgerBuilder AddPepperoni()
  {
    this.Pepperoni = true;
    return this;
  }

  public BurgerBuilder AddLettuce()
  {
    this.Lettuce = true;
    return this;
  }

  public BurgerBuilder AddTomato()
  {
    this.Tomato = true;
    return this;
  }

  public Burger Build()
  {
    return new Burger(this);
  }
}
```
And then it can be used as:

```C#
var burger = new BurgerBuilder(4).AddCheese()
                                .AddPepperoni()
                                .AddLettuce()
                                .AddTomato()
                                .Build();
Console.WriteLine(burger.GetDescription());
```

**When to use?**

When there could be several flavors of an object and to avoid the constructor telescoping. The key difference from the factory pattern is that; factory pattern is to be used when the creation is a one step process while builder pattern is to be used when the creation is a multi step process.

🐑 Prototype
------------
Real world example
> Remember dolly? The sheep that was cloned! Lets not get into the details but the key point here is that it is all about cloning

In plain words
> Create object based on an existing object through cloning.

Wikipedia says
> The prototype pattern is a creational design pattern in software development. It is used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects.

In short, it allows you to create a copy of an existing object and modify it to your needs, instead of going through the trouble of creating an object from scratch and setting it up.

**Programmatic Example**

In C#, it can be easily done using `MemberwiseClone()`

```C#
class Sheep
{
  public string Name { get; set; }

  public string Category { get; set; }

  public Sheep(string name, string category)
  {
    Name = name;
    Category = category;
  }

  public Sheep Clone()
  {
    return MemberwiseClone() as Sheep;
  }
}
```
Then it can be cloned like below
```C#
var original = new Sheep("Jolly", "Mountain Sheep");
Console.WriteLine(original.Name); // Jolly
Console.WriteLine(original.Category); // Mountain Sheep

var cloned = original.Clone();
cloned.Name = "Dolly";
Console.WriteLine(cloned.Name); // Dolly
Console.WriteLine(cloned.Category); // Mountain Sheep
Console.WriteLine(original.Name); // Jolly
```

**When to use?**

When an object is required that is similar to existing object or when the creation would be expensive as compared to cloning.

💍 Singleton
------------
Real world example
> There can only be one president of a country at a time. The same president has to be brought to action, whenever duty calls. President here is singleton.

In plain words
> Ensures that only one object of a particular class is ever created.

Wikipedia says
> In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

Singleton pattern is actually considered an anti-pattern and overuse of it should be avoided. It is not necessarily bad and could have some valid use-cases but should be used with caution because it introduces a global state in your application and change to it in one place could affect in the other areas and it could become pretty difficult to debug. The other bad thing about them is it makes your code tightly coupled plus mocking the singleton could be difficult.

**Programmatic Example**

To create a singleton, make the constructor private, disable cloning, disable extension and create a static variable to house the instance
```C#
public class President
{
  static President instance;
  // Private constructor
  private President()
  {
    //Hiding the Constructor
  }

  // Public constructor
  public static President GetInstance()
  {
    if (instance == null) {
      instance = new President();
    }
    return instance;
  }
}
```
Then in order to use
```C#
President a = President.GetInstance();
President b = President.GetInstance();

Console.WriteLine(a == b); //Output : true
```

🛥️ Object pool
------------

The object pool pattern is a software creational design pattern that uses a set of initialized objects kept ready to use – a "pool" – rather than allocating and destroying them on demand. A client of the pool will request an object from the pool and perform operations on the returned object. When the client has finished, it returns the object to the pool rather than destroying it; this can be done manually or automatically.

Object pools are primarily used for performance: in some circumstances, object pools significantly improve performance. Object pools complicate object lifetime, as objects obtained from and returned to a pool are not actually created or destroyed at this time, and thus require care in implementation.

Care must be taken to ensure the state of the objects returned to the pool is reset back to a sensible state for the next use of the object, otherwise the object may be in a state unexpected by the client, which may cause it to fail. The pool is responsible for resetting the objects, not the clients. Object pools full of objects with dangerously stale state are sometimes called object cesspools and regarded as an anti-pattern.

In the [.NET Base Class Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_Class_Library) there are a few objects that implement this pattern. System.Threading.ThreadPool is configured to have a predefined number of threads to allocate. When the threads are returned, they are available for another computation. Thus, one can use threads without paying the cost of creation and disposal of threads.

**When to use?**

When it is necessary to work with numerous objects that are particularly expensive to instantiate and each object is only needed for a short period of time, the performance of an entire application may be adversely affected. An object pool design pattern may be deemed desirable in cases such as these.

```csharp
namespace DesignPattern.Objectpool;

// The PooledObject class is the type that is expensive or slow to instantiate,
// or that has limited availability, so is to be held in the object pool.
public class PooledObject
{
    private DateTime _createdAt = DateTime.Now;

    public DateTime CreatedAt
    {
        get { return _createdAt; }
    }

    public string TempData { get; set; }
}

// The Pool class controls access to the pooled objects. It maintains a list of available objects and a 
// collection of objects that have been obtained from the pool and are in use. The pool ensures that released objects 
// are returned to a suitable state, ready for reuse. 
public static class Pool
{
    private static List<PooledObject> _available = new List<PooledObject>();
    private static List<PooledObject> _inUse = new List<PooledObject>();

    public static PooledObject GetObject()
    {
        lock (_available)
        {
            if (_available.Count != 0)
            {
                PooledObject po = _available[0];
                _inUse.Add(po);
                _available.RemoveAt(0);
                return po;
            }
            else
            {
                PooledObject po = new PooledObject();
                _inUse.Add(po);
                return po;
            }
        }
    }

    public static void ReleaseObject(PooledObject po)
    {
        CleanUp(po);

        lock (_available)
        {
            _available.Add(po);
            _inUse.Remove(po);
        }
    }

    private static void CleanUp(PooledObject po)
    {
        po.TempData = null;
    }
}
```
