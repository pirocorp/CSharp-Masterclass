## Focusing on the Domain

Shift Thinking from DB-Driven to Domain-Driven. From Designing software based on data storage needs to Designing software based on business needs.

> [The Domain Layer is] responsible for representing **concepts of the business, information about the business situation, and business rules**. State that reflects the business situation is controlled and used here, even though the technical details of storing it are delegated to the infrastructure. **This layer is the heart of business software**.

Eric Evans

### Focus on Behaviors, Not Attributes. 

In the typical data-driven app, we focus on properties. Sometimes, we are all about editing properties and the state of our objects. However, when we are modeling the domain, we need to focus on the behaviors of that domain, not simply on changing the state of objects.
