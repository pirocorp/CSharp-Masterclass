## Focusing on the Domain

Shift Thinking from DB-Driven to Domain-Driven. From Designing software based on data storage needs to Designing software based on business needs.

> [The Domain Layer is] responsible for representing **concepts of the business, information about the business situation, and business rules**.

This layer is the heart of business software.
