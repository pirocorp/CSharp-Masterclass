# Introducing Domain-Driven Design

## Why DDD?

Value Proposition of DDD

- Principles and patterns to **solve difficult problems**
- History of **success** with complex projects
- Aligns with practices from developers **experience**
- **Clear, readable, testable code** that represents the domain


## What does a DDD solution look like?

## What is Domain-Driven Design?

> **Domain-Driven Design** is an approach to software development that centers the development on programming a domain model that has a rich understanding of the processes and rules of a domain.

Martin Fowler

### Gaining a High-Level Understanding of DDD 

- Better Interaction with domain experts
  > You really need to cultivate your ability to communicate with business people to free up people's creative modeling.  
  
  Eric Evans

- Model a **single subdomain** at a time
  - Divide and Conquer - By separating the problem into separate subdomains, we can tackle each problem independently. We are making the problem much easier to solve.
    - Purchase materials - `tasks`, `ubiquitous language`, `unique problems`
    - Engineering - `tasks`, `ubiquitous language`, `unique problems`
    - Manage employees - `tasks`, `ubiquitous language`, `unique problems`
    - Marketing - `tasks`, `ubiquitous language`, `unique problems`
    - Sales - `tasks`, `ubiquitous language`, `unique problems`
  - Modeling - How you decipher and design each subdomain.
- Implementation of subdomains
  - **Separation of Concerns** - plays an important role in implementing subdomains
