# Introducing Domain-Driven Design

## Why DDD?

Value Proposition of DDD

- Principles and patterns to **solve difficult problems**
- History of **success** with complex projects
- Aligns with practices from developers **experience**
- **Clear, readable, testable code** that represents the domain


## What does a DDD solution look like?

## What is Domain-Driven Design?

> **Domain-Driven Design** is an approach to software development that centers the development on programming a domain model that has a rich understanding of the processes and rules of a domain.

Martin Fowler

### Gaining a High-Level Understanding of DDD 

- Better Interaction with domain experts
  > You really need to cultivate your ability to communicate with business people to free up people's creative modeling.  
  
  Eric Evans

- Model a **single subdomain** at a time
  - Divide and Conquer - By separating the problem into separate subdomains, we can tackle each problem independently. We are making the problem much easier to solve.
    - Purchase materials - `tasks`, `ubiquitous language`, `unique problems`
    - Engineering - `tasks`, `ubiquitous language`, `unique problems`
    - Manage employees - `tasks`, `ubiquitous language`, `unique problems`
    - Marketing - `tasks`, `ubiquitous language`, `unique problems`
    - Sales - `tasks`, `ubiquitous language`, `unique problems`
  - Modeling - How you decipher and design each subdomain.
- Implementation of subdomains
  - **Separation of Concerns** - plays an important role in implementing subdomains.


## Goals of DDD

- DDD aims to **tackle business complexity**, not technical complexity. 
  > While Domain-Driven Design provides many technical benefits, such as maintainability, it should be applied **only to complex domains** where the model and the linguistic processes **provide clear benefits** in the **communication of complex information**, and in the formulation of a **common understanding of the domain**.

  Eric Evans, Domain-Driven Design


## Benefits and potential drawbacks of DDD

### Benefits of Domain-Driven Design

- Flexible
- Customerâ€™s vision/perspective of the problem
- Path through a very complex problem
- Well-organized and easily tested code
- Business logic lives in one place
- Many great patterns to leverage

### Drawbacks of Domain-Driven Design

- Be Prepared for Time and Effort
  - Discuss and model the problem with domain experts
  - Isolate domain logic from other parts of application
- Be Prepared for a Learning Curve
  - New principles
  - New patterns
  - New processes
- Be Thoughtful About Possible Overuse - DDD is for handling **complexity in business problems**
  - Not just CRUD or data-driven applications.
  - Not just technical complexity without business domain complexity.
- Requires Team and Business Buy-In
