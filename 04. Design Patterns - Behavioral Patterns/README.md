Behavioral Design Patterns
==========================

In plain words
> It is concerned with assignment of responsibilities between the objects. What makes them different from structural patterns is they don't just specify the structure but also outline the patterns for message passing/communication between them. Or in other words, they assist in answering "How to run a behavior in software component?"

Wikipedia says
> In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

🔗 Chain of Responsibility
-----------------------

Real world example
> For example, you have three payment methods (`A`, `B` and `C`) setup in your account; each having a different amount in it. `A` has 100 USD, `B` has 300 USD and `C` having 1000 USD and the preference for payments is chosen as `A` then `B` then `C`. You try to purchase something that is worth 210 USD. Using Chain of Responsibility, first of all account `A` will be checked if it can make the purchase, if yes purchase will be made and the chain will be broken. If not, request will move forward to account `B` checking for amount if yes chain will be broken otherwise the request will keep forwarding till it finds the suitable handler. Here `A`, `B` and `C` are links of the chain and the whole phenomenon is Chain of Responsibility.

In plain words
> It helps building a chain of objects. Request enters from one end and keeps going from object to object till it finds the suitable handler.

Wikipedia says
> In object-oriented design, the chain-of-responsibility pattern is a design pattern consisting of a source of command objects and a series of processing objects. Each processing object contains logic that defines the types of command objects that it can handle; the rest are passed to the next processing object in the chain.

**Programmatic Example**

Translating our account example above. First of all we have a base account having the logic for chaining the accounts together and some accounts

```C#
abstract class Account
{
  private Account mSuccessor;
  protected decimal mBalance;

  public void SetNext(Account account)
  {
    mSuccessor = account;
  }

  public void Pay(decimal amountTopay)
  {
    if (CanPay(amountTopay))
    {
      Console.WriteLine($"Paid {amountTopay:c} using {this.GetType().Name}.");
    }
    else if (this.mSuccessor != null)
    {
      Console.WriteLine($"Cannot pay using {this.GetType().Name}. Proceeding..");
      mSuccessor.Pay(amountTopay);
    }
    else
    {
      throw new Exception("None of the accounts have enough balance");
    }
  }
  private bool CanPay(decimal amount)
  {
    return mBalance >= amount;
  }
}

class Bank : Account
{
  public Bank(decimal balance)
  {
    this.mBalance = balance;
  }
}

class Paypal : Account
{
  public Paypal(decimal balance)
  {
    this.mBalance = balance;
  }
}

class Bitcoin : Account
{
  public Bitcoin(decimal balance)
  {
    this.mBalance = balance;
  }
}
```

Now let's prepare the chain using the links defined above (i.e. Bank, Paypal, Bitcoin)

```C#
// Let's prepare a chain like below
//      $bank->$paypal->$bitcoin
//
// First priority bank
//      If bank can't pay then paypal
//      If paypal can't pay then bit coin
var bank = new Bank(100);          // Bank with balance 100
var paypal = new Paypal(200);      // Paypal with balance 200
var bitcoin = new Bitcoin(300);    // Bitcoin with balance 300

bank.SetNext(paypal);
paypal.SetNext(bitcoin);

// Let's try to pay using the first priority i.e. bank
bank.Pay(259);
// Output will be
// ==============
// Cannot pay using bank. Proceeding ..
// Cannot pay using paypal. Proceeding ..:
// Paid 259 using Bitcoin!
```

👮 Command
-------

Real world example
> A generic example would be you ordering food at a restaurant. You (i.e. `Client`) ask the waiter (i.e. `Invoker`) to bring some food (i.e. `Command`) and waiter simply forwards the request to Chef (i.e. `Receiver`) who has the knowledge of what and how to cook.
> Another example would be you (i.e. `Client`) switching on (i.e. `Command`) the television (i.e. `Receiver`) using a remote control (`Invoker`).

In plain words
> Allows you to encapsulate actions in objects. The key idea behind this pattern is to provide the means to decouple client from receiver.

Wikipedia says
> In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters.

**Programmatic Example**

First of all we have the receiver that has the implementation of every action that could be performed
```C#
// Receiver
class Bulb
{
  public void TurnOn()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Bulb has been lit");
  }

  public void TurnOff()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Darkness!");
  }
}
```
then we have an interface that each of the commands are going to implement and then we have a set of commands
```C#
interface ICommand
{
  void Execute();
  void Undo();
  void Redo();
}

// Command
class TurnOn : ICommand
{
  private Bulb mBulb;

  public TurnOn(Bulb bulb)
  {
    mBulb = bulb ?? throw new ArgumentNullException("Bulb", "Bulb cannot be null");
  }

  public void Execute()
  {
    mBulb.TurnOn();
  }

  public void Undo()
  {
    mBulb.TurnOff();
  }

  public void Redo()
  {
    Execute();
  }
}

class TurnOff : ICommand
{
  private Bulb mBulb;

  public TurnOff(Bulb bulb)
  {
    mBulb = bulb ?? throw new ArgumentNullException("Bulb", "Bulb cannot be null");
  }

  public void Execute()
  {
    mBulb.TurnOff();
  }

  public void Undo()
  {
    mBulb.TurnOn();
  }

  public void Redo()
  {
    Execute();
  }
}
```
Then we have an `Invoker` with whom the client will interact to process any commands
```C#
// Invoker
class RemoteControl
{
  public void Submit(ICommand command)
  {
    command.Execute();
  }
}
```
Finally let's see how we can use it in our client
```C#
  var bulb = new Bulb();

  var turnOn = new TurnOn(bulb);
  var turnOff = new TurnOff(bulb);

  var remote = new RemoteControl();
  remote.Submit(turnOn); // Bulb has been lit!
  remote.Submit(turnOff); // Darkness!

  Console.ReadLine();
```

Command pattern can also be used to implement a transaction based system. Where you keep maintaining the history of commands as soon as you execute them. If the final command is successfully executed, all good otherwise just iterate through the history and keep executing the `undo` on all the executed commands.

➿ Iterator
--------

Real world example
> An old radio set will be a good example of iterator, where user could start at some channel and then use next or previous buttons to go through the respective channels. Or take an example of MP3 player or a TV set where you could press the next and previous buttons to go through the consecutive channels or in other words they all provide an interface to iterate through the respective channels, songs or radio stations.

In plain words
> It presents a way to access the elements of an object without exposing the underlying presentation.

Wikipedia says
> In object-oriented programming, the iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements. The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.

**Programmatic example**

In C# it can be done by implementing IEnumerable<T>. Translating our radio statiIons example from above. First of all we have `RadioStation`

```C#
class RadioStation
{
  private float mFrequency;

  public RadioStation(float frequency)
  {
    mFrequency = frequency;
  }

  public float GetFrequecy()
  {
    return mFrequency;
  }

}

```
Then we have our iterator

```C#
class StationList : IEnumerable<RadioStation>
{
  List<RadioStation> mStations = new List<RadioStation>();

  public RadioStation this[int index]
  {
    get { return mStations[index]; }
    set { mStations.Insert(index, value); }
  }

  public void Add(RadioStation station)
  {
    mStations.Add(station);
  }

  public void Remove(RadioStation station)
  {
    mStations.Remove(station);
  }

  public IEnumerator<RadioStation> GetEnumerator()
  {
    return this.GetEnumerator();
  }

  IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator()
  {
    //Use can switch to this internal collection if you do not want to transform
    //return mStations.GetEnumerator();

    //use this if you want to transform the object before rendering
    foreach (var x in mStations)
    {
      yield return x;
    }
  }
}
```
And then it can be used as
```C#
var stations = new StationList();
var station1 = new RadioStation(89);
stations.Add(station1);

var station2 = new RadioStation(101);
stations.Add(station2);

var station3 = new RadioStation(102);
stations.Add(station3);

foreach(var x in stations)
{
  Console.Write(x.GetFrequecy());
}

var q = stations.Where(x => x.GetFrequecy() == 89).FirstOrDefault();
Console.WriteLine(q.GetFrequecy());

Console.ReadLine();
```

👽 Mediator
========

Real world example
> A general example would be when you talk to someone on your mobile phone, there is a network provider sitting between you and them and your conversation goes through it instead of being directly sent. In this case network provider is mediator.

In plain words
> Mediator pattern adds a third party object (called mediator) to control the interaction between two objects (called colleagues). It helps reduce the coupling between the classes communicating with each other. Because now they don't need to have the knowledge of each other's implementation.

Wikipedia says
> In software engineering, the mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. This pattern is considered to be a behavioral pattern due to the way it can alter the program's running behavior.

**Programmatic Example**

Here is the simplest example of a chat room (i.e. mediator) with users (i.e. colleagues) sending messages to each other.

First of all, we have the mediator i.e. the chat room

```C#
interface IChatRoomMediator
{
  void ShowMessage(User user, string message);
}

//Mediator
class ChatRoom : IChatRoomMediator
{
  public void ShowMessage(User user, string message)
  {
    Console.WriteLine($"{DateTime.Now.ToString("MMMM dd, H:mm")} [{user.GetName()}]:{message}");
  }
}
```

Then we have our users i.e. colleagues
```C#
class User
{
  private string mName;
  private IChatRoomMediator mChatRoom;

  public User(string name, IChatRoomMediator chatroom)
  {
    mChatRoom = chatroom;
    mName = name;
  }

  public string GetName()
  {
    return mName;
  }

  public void Send(string message)
  {
    mChatRoom.ShowMessage(this, message);
  }
}
```
And the usage
```C#
var mediator = new ChatRoom();

var john = new User("John", mediator);
var jane = new User("Jane", mediator);

john.Send("Hi there!");
jane.Send("Hey!");

//April 14, 20:05[John]:Hi there!
//April 14, 20:05[Jane]:Hey!
```

💾 Memento
-------
Real world example
> Take the example of calculator (i.e. originator), where whenever you perform some calculation the last calculation is saved in memory (i.e. memento) so that you can get back to it and maybe get it restored using some action buttons (i.e. caretaker).

In plain words
> Memento pattern is about capturing and storing the current state of an object in a manner that it can be restored later on in a smooth manner.

Wikipedia says
> The memento pattern is a software design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo via rollback).

Usually useful when you need to provide some sort of undo functionality.

**Programmatic Example**

Lets take an example of text editor which keeps saving the state from time to time and that you can restore if you want.

First of all we have our memento object that will be able to hold the editor state

```C#
class EditorMemento
{
  private string mContent;

  public EditorMemento(string content)
  {
    mContent = content;
  }

  public string Content
  {
    get
    {
      return mContent;
    }
  }
}
```

Then we have our editor i.e. originator that is going to use memento object

```C#
class Editor {

  private string mContent = string.Empty;
  private EditorMemento memento;

  public Editor()
  {
    memento = new EditorMemento(string.Empty);
  }

  public void Type(string words)
  {
    mContent = String.Concat(mContent," ", words);
  }

  public string Content
  {
    get
    {
      return mContent;
    }
  }

  public void Save()
  {
    memento = new EditorMemento(mContent);
  }

  public void Restore()
  {
    mContent = memento.Content;
  }
}
```

And then it can be used as

```C#
var editor = new Editor();

//Type some stuff
editor.Type("This is the first sentence.");
editor.Type("This is second.");

// Save the state to restore to : This is the first sentence. This is second.
editor.Save();

//Type some more
editor.Type("This is third.");

//Output the content
Console.WriteLine(editor.Content); // This is the first sentence. This is second. This is third.

//Restoring to last saved state
editor.Restore();

Console.Write(editor.Content); // This is the first sentence. This is second

```

😎 Observer
--------
Real world example
> A good example would be the job seekers where they subscribe to some job posting site and they are notified whenever there is a matching job opportunity.   

In plain words
> Defines a dependency between objects so that whenever an object changes its state, all its dependents are notified.

Wikipedia says
> The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

**Programmatic example**

Translating our example from above. First of all we have job seekers that need to be notified for a job posting
```C#
class JobPost
{
  public string Title { get; private set; }

  public JobPost(string title)
  {
    Title = title;
  }
}
class JobSeeker : IObserver<JobPost>
{
  public string Name { get; private set; }

  public JobSeeker(string name)
  {
    Name = name;
  }

  //Method is not being called by JobPostings class currently
  public void OnCompleted()
  {
    //No Implementation
  }

  //Method is not being called by JobPostings class currently
  public void OnError(Exception error)
  {
    //No Implementation
  }

  public void OnNext(JobPost value)
  {
    Console.WriteLine($"Hi {Name} ! New job posted: {value.Title}");
  }
}
```
Then we have our job postings to which the job seekers will subscribe
```C#
class JobPostings : IObservable<JobPost>
{
  private List<IObserver<JobPost>> mObservers;
  private List<JobPost> mJobPostings;

  public JobPostings()
  {
    mObservers = new List<IObserver<JobPost>>();
    mJobPostings = new List<JobPost>();
  }

  public IDisposable Subscribe(IObserver<JobPost> observer)
  {
    // Check whether observer is already registered. If not, add it
    if (!mObservers.Contains(observer))
    {
      mObservers.Add(observer);
    }
    return new Unsubscriber<JobPost>(mObservers, observer);
  }

  private void Notify(JobPost jobPost)
  {
    foreach(var observer in mObservers)
    {
      observer.OnNext(jobPost);
    }
  }

  public void AddJob(JobPost jobPost)
  {
    mJobPostings.Add(jobPost);
    Notify(jobPost);
  }

}

internal class Unsubscriber<JobPost> : IDisposable
{
  private List<IObserver<JobPost>> mObservers;
  private IObserver<JobPost> mObserver;

  internal Unsubscriber(List<IObserver<JobPost>> observers, IObserver<JobPost> observer)
  {
    this.mObservers = observers;
    this.mObserver = observer;
  }

  public void Dispose()
  {
    if (mObservers.Contains(mObserver))
      mObservers.Remove(mObserver);
  }
}
```
Then it can be used as
```C#
//Create Subscribers
var johnDoe = new JobSeeker("John Doe");
var janeDoe = new JobSeeker("Jane Doe");

//Create publisher and attch subscribers
var jobPostings = new JobPostings();
jobPostings.Subscribe(johnDoe);
jobPostings.Subscribe(janeDoe);

//Add a new job and see if subscribers get notified
jobPostings.AddJob(new JobPost("Software Engineer"));

//Output
// Hi John Doe! New job posted: Software Engineer
// Hi Jane Doe! New job posted: Software Engineer

Console.ReadLine();
```

🏃 Visitor
-------
Real world example
> Consider someone visiting Dubai. They just need a way (i.e. visa) to enter Dubai. After arrival, they can come and visit any place in Dubai on their own without having to ask for permission or to do some leg work in order to visit any place here; just let them know of a place and they can visit it. Visitor pattern lets you do just that, it helps you add places to visit so that they can visit as much as they can without having to do any legwork.

In plain words
> Visitor pattern lets you add further operations to objects without having to modify them.

Wikipedia says
> In object-oriented programming and software engineering, the visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures. It is one way to follow the open/closed principle.

**Programmatic example**

Let's take an example of a zoo simulation where we have several different kinds of animals and we have to make them Sound. Let's translate this using visitor pattern

```C#
// Visitee
interface IAnimal
{
  void Accept(IAnimalOperation operation);
}

// Visitor
interface IAnimalOperation
{
  void VisitMonkey(Monkey monkey);
  void VisitLion(Lion lion);
  void VisitDolphin(Dolphin dolphin);
}
```
Then we have our implementations for the animals
```C#
class Monkey : IAnimal
{
  public void Shout()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Oooh o aa aa!");
  }

  public void Accept(IAnimalOperation operation)
  {
      operation.VisitMonkey(this);
  }
}

class Lion : IAnimal
{
  public void Roar()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Roaar!");
  }

  public void Accept(IAnimalOperation operation)
  {
      operation.VisitLion(this);
  }
}

class Dolphin : IAnimal
{
  public void Speak()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Tuut tittu tuutt!");
  }

  public void Accept(IAnimalOperation operation)
  {
      operation.VisitDolphin(this);
  }
}
```
Let's implement our visitor
```C#
class Speak : IAnimalOperation
{
  public void VisitDolphin(Dolphin dolphin)
  {
    dolphin.Speak();
  }

  public void VisitLion(Lion lion)
  {
    lion.Roar();
  }

  public void VisitMonkey(Monkey monkey)
  {
    monkey.Shout();
  }
}
```

And then it can be used as
```C#
var monkey = new Monkey();
var lion = new Lion();
var dolphin = new Dolphin();

var speak = new Speak();

monkey.Accept(speak);    // Ooh oo aa aa!
lion.Accept(speak);      // Roaaar!
dolphin.Accept(speak);   // Tuut tutt tuutt!

```
We could have done this simply by having an inheritance hierarchy for the animals but then we would have to modify the animals whenever we would have to add new actions to animals. But now we will not have to change them. For example, let's say we are asked to add the jump behavior to the animals, we can simply add that by creating a new visitor i.e.

```C#
class Jump : IAnimalOperation
{
  public void VisitDolphin(Dolphin dolphin)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Walked on water a little and disappeared!");
  }

  public void VisitLion(Lion lion)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Jumped 7 feet! Back on the ground!");
  }

  public void VisitMonkey(Monkey monkey)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Jumped 20 feet high! on to the tree!");
  }
}
```
And for the usage
```C#
var jump = new Jump();

monkey.Accept(speak);   // Ooh oo aa aa!
monkey.Accept(jump);    // Jumped 20 feet high! on to the tree!

lion.Accept(speak);     // Roaaar!
lion.Accept(jump);      // Jumped 7 feet! Back on the ground!

dolphin.Accept(speak);  // Tuut tutt tuutt!
dolphin.Accept(jump);   // Walked on water a little and disappeared

```

💡 Strategy
--------

Real world example
> Consider the example of sorting, we implemented bubble sort but the data started to grow and bubble sort started getting very slow. In order to tackle this we implemented Quick sort. But now although the quick sort algorithm was doing better for large datasets, it was very slow for smaller datasets. In order to handle this we implemented a strategy where for small datasets, bubble sort will be used and for larger, quick sort.

In plain words
> Strategy pattern allows you to switch the algorithm or strategy based upon the situation.

Wikipedia says
> In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioural software design pattern that enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime.

**Programmatic example**

Translating our example from above. First of all we have our strategy interface and different strategy implementations

```C#
interface ISortStrategy
{
  List<int> Sort(List<int> dataset);
}

class BubbleSortStrategy : ISortStrategy
{
  public List<int> Sort(List<int> dataset)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Sorting using Bubble Sort !");
    return dataset;
  }
}

class QuickSortStrategy : ISortStrategy
{
  public List<int> Sort(List<int> dataset)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Sorting using Quick Sort !");
    return dataset;
  }
}
```

And then we have our client that is going to use any strategy
```C#
class Sorter
{
  private readonly ISortStrategy mSorter;

  public Sorter(ISortStrategy sorter)
  {
    mSorter = sorter;
  }

  public List<int> Sort(List<int> unSortedList)
  {
    return mSorter.Sort(unSortedList);
  }
}
```
And it can be used as
```C#
var unSortedList = new List<int> { 1, 10, 2, 16, 19 };

var sorter = new Sorter(new BubbleSortStrategy());
sorter.Sort(unSortedList); // // Output : Sorting using Bubble Sort !

sorter = new Sorter(new QuickSortStrategy());
sorter.Sort(unSortedList); // // Output : Sorting using Quick Sort !
```

💢 State
-----
Real world example
> Imagine you are using some drawing application, you choose the paint brush to draw. Now the brush changes its behavior based on the selected color i.e. if you have chosen red color it will draw in red, if blue then it will be in blue etc.  

In plain words
> It lets you change the behavior of a class when the state changes.

Wikipedia says
> The state pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that implements a state machine in an object-oriented way. With the state pattern, a state machine is implemented by implementing each individual state as a derived class of the state pattern interface, and implementing state transitions by invoking methods defined by the pattern's superclass.
> The state pattern can be interpreted as a strategy pattern which is able to switch the current strategy through invocations of methods defined in the pattern's interface.

**Programmatic example**

Let's take an example of text editor, it lets you change the state of text that is typed i.e. if you have selected bold, it starts writing in bold, if italic then in italics etc.

First of all we have our state interface and some state implementations

```C#
interface IWritingState {

  void Write(string words);

}

class UpperCase : IWritingState
{
  public void Write(string words)
  {
    Console.WriteLine(words.ToUpper());
  }
}

class LowerCase : IWritingState
{
  public void Write(string words)
  {
    Console.WriteLine(words.ToLower());
  }
}

class DefaultText : IWritingState
{
  public void Write(string words)
  {
    Console.WriteLine(words);
  }
}
```
Then we have our editor
```C#
class TextEditor {

  private IWritingState mState;

  public TextEditor()
  {
    mState = new DefaultText();
  }

  public void SetState(IWritingState state)
  {
    mState = state;
  }

  public void Type(string words)
  {
    mState.Write(words);
  }

}
```
And then it can be used as
```C#
var editor = new TextEditor();

editor.Type("First line");

editor.SetState(new UpperCase());

editor.Type("Second Line");
editor.Type("Third Line");

editor.SetState(new LowerCase());

📒 Template Method
---------------

Real world example
> Suppose we are getting some house built. The steps for building might look like
> - Prepare the base of house
> - Build the walls
> - Add roof
> - Add other floors

> The order of these steps could never be changed i.e. you can't build the roof before building the walls etc but each of the steps could be modified for example walls can be made of wood or polyester or stone.

In plain words
> Template method defines the skeleton of how a certain algorithm could be performed, but defers the implementation of those steps to the children classes.

Wikipedia says
> In software engineering, the template method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. It lets one redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

**Programmatic Example**

Imagine we have a build tool that helps us test, lint, build, generate build reports (i.e. code coverage reports, linting report etc) and deploy our app on the test server.

First of all we have our base class that specifies the skeleton for the build algorithm
```C#
abstract class Builder
{
    // Template method
    public void Build()
    {
      Test();
      Lint();
      Assemble();
      Deploy();
    }

    abstract public void Test();
    abstract public void Lint();
    abstract public void Assemble();
    abstract public void Deploy();
}
```

Then we can have our implementations

```C#
class AndroidBuilder : Builder
{
  public override void Assemble()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Assembling the android build");
  }

  public override void Deploy()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Deploying android build to server");
  }

  public override void Lint()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Linting the android code");
  }

  public override void Test()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Running android tests");
  }
}


class IosBuilder : Builder
{
  public override void Assemble()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Assembling the ios build");
  }

  public override void Deploy()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Deploying ios build to server");
  }

  public override void Lint()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Linting the ios code");
  }

  public override void Test()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Running ios tests");
  }
}

```
And then it can be used as

```C#
var androidBuilder = new AndroidBuilder();
androidBuilder.Build();

// Output:
// Running android tests
// Linting the android code
// Assembling the android build
// Deploying android build to server

var iosBuilder = new IosBuilder();
iosBuilder.Build();

// Output:
// Running ios tests
// Linting the ios code
// Assembling the ios build
// Deploying ios build to server
```
